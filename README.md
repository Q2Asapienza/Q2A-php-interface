# Q2A_Pi

Interface for python for communicating with q2a.di.uniroma1.it

## Setup

To use the library simply clone it into your project directory
```
git clone https://github.com/fc-dev/Q2A_Pi
```
Or add it as a submodule if you are working in a git repository
```
git submodule add https://github.com/fc-dev/Q2A_Pi
```

Then you can use it from python by simply importing it this way:
```python
import Q2A_Pi
```
or if you prefer to use the classes directly without having to write the package name:
```python
from Q2A_Pi import *
```
Check out the [wiki]() for basic usages example

### Prerequisites

To run the program you need python (3.7.4) installed, and the libraries:
```
requests
lxml
cssselect
```
With their dependencies too.
