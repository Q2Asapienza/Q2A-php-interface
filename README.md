# Q2A php interface

Interface for PHP for communicating with q2a.di.uniroma1.it

## Setup

To use the library simply clone or fork it into your project directory
```
git clone https://github.com/Q2Asapienza/Q2A-php-interface
```
Or add it as a submodule if you are working in a git repository
```
git submodule add https://github.com/Q2Asapienza/Q2A-php-interface
```

Then you can use it from python by simply including or requiring it:
```php
require './Q2A-php-interface/Q2A.php';
```
Check out the [wiki]() for basic usages example (just kidding, no examples for now)

### Prerequisites

To run the program you need php installed (at least 5.6, 7.2 is preferred).
